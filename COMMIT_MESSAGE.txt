Fix Windows desktop build - resolve false success and packaging issues

CRITICAL FIX: Backend output directory mismatch
- Build scripts were outputting to wrong directory (backend/ vs resources/backend/)
- electron-builder couldn't find backend binaries despite successful compilation
- Installers were created but missing backend, causing app to fail at runtime
- Fixed all build scripts to output to resources/backend/ as expected by package.json

Build Process Improvements:
- Add resource validation before packaging (fail fast if resources missing)
- Add proper exit code checking after all dotnet/npm commands  
- Add SkipFrontendBuild flag to prevent duplicate frontend builds
- Remove references to non-existent optional resources (ffmpeg, samples)
- Create resources/ directory with proper documentation and .gitignore

Code Compilation Fixes:
- Fix CS9031: Rename BlurEffect.Type to BlurStyle (was hiding VideoEffect.Type)
- Fix NETSDK1087: Consolidate duplicate WindowsForms framework references
- Fix RS1032: Clean up analyzer diagnostic message format
- Fix RS2007: Add proper analyzer release header

Security Updates:
- Update SixLabors.ImageSharp 3.1.9 → 3.1.10 (CVE fix)
- Update Electron 28.1.0 → 35.7.5 (ASAR vulnerability fix)

Documentation:
- Add BUILD_FIXES_SUMMARY.md - comprehensive fix documentation
- Add BUILD_VERIFICATION.md - testing and troubleshooting guide  
- Add WINDOWS_BUILD_FIX_COMPLETE.md - executive summary
- Add resources/README.md - resource directory documentation
