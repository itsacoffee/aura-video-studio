# Documentation Archive

This directory contains **historical documentation** from the Aura Video Studio project. These files are preserved for reference and provenance but are **not canonical guides**.

⚠️ **Important**: All files in this archive may contain outdated information, references to superseded implementations, or details specific to past pull requests.

## What's Archived Here

### root-summaries/
Historical implementation summaries, PR summaries, and audit documents from the repository root. These documents described specific features, fixes, or changes at a point in time:
- Feature implementations and enhancements
- Bug fixes and validation summaries
- PR-specific implementation details
- Integration and orchestration work
- Performance and optimization reports

### aura-web/
Historical frontend implementation documentation, build reports, and feature-specific summaries from the Aura.Web project:
- Build optimization results
- Frontend feature implementations
- Code quality reports
- UI/UX implementation summaries

### docs-old/
Previously current documentation that has been superseded by newer guides or consolidated into canonical documentation:
- Old verification and testing documentation
- Superseded implementation notes
- Legacy troubleshooting guides

### (Existing archive files)
Agent summaries, verification checklists, test results, and other historical documentation from previous development cycles.

## Why These Are Archived

These documents were created during active development to:
1. Track implementation progress
2. Document decisions made
3. Verify completion of work
4. Provide context for changes

They are now archived because:
- The work described is complete and integrated
- The features documented are now part of the main codebase
- Current canonical documentation supersedes these historical notes
- They serve as historical reference and provenance only
- They may not reflect Advanced Mode gating or current feature availability

## Finding Current Documentation

## Note

If you're researching how a specific feature was implemented or why certain decisions were made, these archived documents may provide valuable historical context.
