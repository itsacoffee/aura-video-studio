# PR #6: LLM-Driven Scene Relationship and Narrative Flow Analysis - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive LLM-driven narrative flow analysis system that enhances inter-scene coherence by analyzing narrative relationships between consecutive scenes, ensuring smooth conceptual transitions and maintaining story arc integrity throughout videos.

## Implementation Details

### New Services

#### 1. NarrativeFlowAnalyzer
**Location:** `Aura.Core/Services/Narrative/NarrativeFlowAnalyzer.cs`

**Functionality:**
- **Pairwise Coherence Analysis**: Analyzes each consecutive scene pair using LLM to score coherence (0-100)
- **Narrative Arc Validation**: Validates overall story structure against video type (educational, entertainment, documentary, tutorial)
- **Bridging Text Generation**: Generates transition text for scenes with coherence scores below 70
- **Continuity Issue Detection**: Identifies logical inconsistencies, abrupt transitions, and orphaned scenes
- **Fallback Support**: Uses rule-based analysis when LLM providers fail

**Key Methods:**
- `AnalyzeNarrativeFlowAsync()` - Main entry point for comprehensive analysis
- `AnalyzePairwiseCoherenceAsync()` - Analyzes scene-to-scene transitions
- `AnalyzeNarrativeArcAsync()` - Validates overall story structure
- `GenerateBridgingSuggestionsAsync()` - Creates bridging text for gaps

#### 2. SceneCoherenceOptimizer
**Location:** `Aura.Core/Services/Narrative/SceneCoherenceOptimizer.cs`

**Functionality:**
- **Scene Reordering**: Suggests optimal scene ordering to improve coherence
- **Duration Constraints**: Maintains total video duration within ±5% of target
- **Coherence Gain**: Ensures improvements of at least 15 points
- **Priority Handling**: Prioritizes resolving critical continuity issues
- **Detailed Rationale**: Provides explanation for reordering suggestions

**Key Methods:**
- `OptimizeSceneOrderAsync()` - Main optimization entry point
- `FindBestReordering()` - Evaluates reordering strategies
- `TrySwapScenes()` - Attempts adjacent scene swapping
- `TryGreedyOptimization()` - Greedy approach for complex cases

### LLM Integration

#### Extended ILlmProvider Interface
**Location:** `Aura.Core/Providers/IProviders.cs`

**New Methods:**

1. **AnalyzeSceneCoherenceAsync**
   - Input: Two scene texts, video goal
   - Output: `SceneCoherenceResult` with score, connection types, confidence, reasoning
   - Purpose: Analyze narrative flow between consecutive scenes

2. **ValidateNarrativeArcAsync**
   - Input: All scene texts, video goal, video type
   - Output: `NarrativeArcResult` with validation status, detected/expected structure, issues, recommendations
   - Purpose: Validate overall story structure

3. **GenerateTransitionTextAsync**
   - Input: Two scene texts, video goal
   - Output: Bridging text string
   - Purpose: Create smooth transitions for low-coherence gaps

#### Provider Implementations

**OpenAiLlmProvider** (`Aura.Providers/Llm/OpenAiLlmProvider.cs`):
- Full implementation with structured JSON prompts
- Temperature: 0.3 for coherence/validation, 0.7 for text generation
- Timeout: 30-45 seconds depending on complexity
- JSON mode for structured responses
- Comprehensive error handling with null returns

**RuleBasedLlmProvider** (`Aura.Providers/Llm/RuleBasedLlmProvider.cs`):
- Fallback implementation using heuristics
- Word overlap analysis for coherence
- Pattern matching for connection types
- Basic arc validation with generic expectations
- Template-based transition generation

**Other Providers** (Gemini, Ollama, Azure):
- Stub implementations returning null
- Graceful degradation to fallback logic

### Expected Narrative Structures

**Educational Videos**: problem → explanation → solution
**Entertainment Videos**: setup → conflict → resolution
**Documentary Videos**: introduction → evidence → conclusion
**Tutorial Videos**: overview → steps → summary
**General Videos**: introduction → body → conclusion

### Connection Types

- **Causal**: Scene B follows logically from scene A
- **Thematic**: Shared topics or concepts between scenes
- **Prerequisite**: Scene A must come before scene B for understanding
- **Callback**: Scene B references earlier scenes for cohesion
- **Sequential**: Simple chronological flow
- **Contrast**: Scene B contrasts with scene A intentionally

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Major breaks in narrative flow (coherence < 40)
- **Warning**: Weak transitions needing attention (coherence 40-70)
- **Info**: Minor suggestions for improvement (coherence 70-85)

## Testing

### Test Coverage

**NarrativeFlowAnalyzerTests** (8 tests):
- ✅ Two-scene analysis returns one pairwise coherence
- ✅ Low coherence detection triggers critical issues
- ✅ Low coherence generates bridging suggestions
- ✅ LLM failure triggers fallback analysis
- ✅ Educational video type validates correct arc
- ✅ Performance completes within 8 seconds for 10 scenes
- ✅ Single scene returns empty pairwise coherence
- ✅ Warning-level coherence detects warning issues

**SceneCoherenceOptimizerTests** (9 tests):
- ✅ High coherence returns no reordering
- ✅ Low coherence suggests reordering
- ✅ Duration constraint maintained (±5%)
- ✅ Minimal coherence gain returns null
- ✅ Few scenes (< 3) returns null
- ✅ Multiple low-coherence pairs prioritizes critical
- ✅ Valid rationale returned
- ✅ Original order preserved in suggestions
- ✅ Correct duration change calculation

**Total: 17/17 tests passing**

### Performance Validation

**10-Scene Video Analysis:**
- Target: < 8 seconds
- Actual: Validated in tests
- Breakdown:
  - 9 pairwise coherence analyses
  - 1 narrative arc validation
  - Bridging suggestion generation (as needed)
  - Continuity issue detection

## Integration Points

### Existing SceneRelationshipMapper
**Location:** `Aura.Core/Services/PacingServices/SceneRelationshipMapper.cs`

**Integration Strategy:**
- SceneRelationshipMapper provides rule-based baseline analysis
- NarrativeFlowAnalyzer provides deep LLM-enhanced analysis
- Both systems can work independently or in combination
- Rule-based logic serves as fallback when LLM unavailable

### VideoOrchestrator Integration (Ready for Next Phase)
**Location:** `Aura.Core/Orchestrator/VideoOrchestrator.cs`

**Planned Integration Steps:**
1. Add narrative analysis step after scene parsing
2. Call `NarrativeFlowAnalyzer.AnalyzeNarrativeFlowAsync()`
3. Review continuity issues and reordering suggestions
4. Optionally apply SceneCoherenceOptimizer suggestions
5. Generate bridging text for low-coherence transitions
6. Add configuration flag: `EnableNarrativeFlowAnalysis`

**Configuration Considerations:**
- Should integrate with existing pacing optimization
- Respect user's auto-apply settings
- Log analysis results for debugging
- Progress reporting via `IProgress<string>`

- Incremental analysis for script edits
- Configurable timeout values per provider

### Resource Usage
- Memory: Minimal (analysis results are lightweight)
- Network: Dependent on LLM provider (3-10 API calls per analysis)
- CPU: Minimal (mostly I/O bound)
- Time: < 8 seconds for 10 scenes (current), can be optimized with parallelization

## Security Considerations

### API Key Handling
- All LLM provider API keys stored securely
- No keys logged or exposed in error messages
- Validation of API key format before use

### Input Validation
- Scene text sanitized before LLM calls
- Video type validated against allowed types
- Coherence scores clamped to 0-100 range

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
✅ All public methods have XML documentation
✅ Complex algorithms explained with inline comments
✅ Model properties documented with summaries

### User Documentation (Recommended)
- Guide on interpreting coherence scores
- Best practices for video types
- Understanding continuity issue severities
- How to use reordering suggestions
- Troubleshooting common narrative flow issues

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust, LLM-driven narrative flow analysis system that meets all acceptance criteria. The code is production-ready, well-tested, and follows all project conventions. The system gracefully degrades when LLM providers are unavailable and provides actionable insights for improving video narrative quality.

The implementation is ready for integration with the VideoOrchestrator pipeline and can be enabled via configuration without breaking existing workflows.
