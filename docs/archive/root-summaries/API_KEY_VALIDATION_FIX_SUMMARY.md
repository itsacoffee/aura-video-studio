# API Key Validation Fix Summary

## Problem

During the first-run onboarding wizard, when users attempted to validate API keys (OpenAI, Pexels, ElevenLabs, etc.), they would receive the error:

```
Could not validate API key: Failed to save API key: Precondition Required
```

This prevented users from completing the onboarding process and configuring their API keys.

## Root Cause

The `FirstRunMiddleware` (located at `Aura.Api/Middleware/FirstRunMiddleware.cs`) was designed to block all API endpoints with a `428 Precondition Required` status when the first-run wizard was not yet completed. However, this created a chicken-and-egg problem:

1. The onboarding wizard needs to call certain API endpoints to complete setup
2. But those endpoints were blocked until setup was complete
3. Therefore, setup could never be completed

### Blocked Endpoints During Onboarding

The following endpoints required by the onboarding process were being blocked:

1. **`POST /api/apikeys/save`** - Saves API keys to disk
2. **`POST /api/providers/validate`** - Validates API keys with the respective providers
3. **`POST /api/dependencies/rescan`** - Scans for installed dependencies

## Solution

Added the following path prefixes to the middleware's whitelist (lines 34-36 in `FirstRunMiddleware.cs`):

```csharp
path.StartsWith("/api/dependencies", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) ||
path.StartsWith("/api/apikeys", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) ||
path.StartsWith("/api/providers", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) ||
```

This allows these critical onboarding endpoints to be called before the first-run wizard is completed.

## Frontend Flow (Reference)

The API key validation flow in the frontend (`Aura.Web/src/state/onboarding.ts`, line 711-835):

1. **Format Validation** (client-side): Validates the API key format (e.g., OpenAI keys start with "sk-")
2. **Save API Key**: Calls `POST /api/apikeys/save` to store the key
3. **Validate API Key**: Calls `POST /api/providers/validate` to verify the key with the provider
4. **Update UI**: Shows success or error message to the user

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test coverage in `Aura.Tests/FirstRunMiddlewareTests.cs` with 13 test cases:

### Test Scenarios

1. **Onboarding endpoints allowed before setup** (6 tests):
   - `/api/apikeys/save` ✅
   - `/api/providers/validate` ✅
   - `/api/dependencies/rescan` ✅
   - `/api/preflight` ✅ (already whitelisted)
   - `/api/probes/run` ✅ (already whitelisted)
   - `/api/downloads/ffmpeg/install` ✅ (already whitelisted)

2. **Non-onboarding endpoints blocked before setup** (3 tests):
   - `/api/jobs` ⛔
   - `/api/videos/generate` ⛔
   - `/api/dashboard` ⛔

3. **All endpoints allowed after setup completion** (3 tests):
   - Verified that all endpoints work normally after wizard completion

4. **Health endpoints always accessible** (1 test):
   - `/api/health/*` endpoints always accessible regardless of setup status

## Security Considerations

### Why This Is Safe

1. **Read-only operations**: The whitelisted endpoints perform read operations (validation) and write to user-specific storage, not system-critical data
2. **No privilege escalation**: API keys are stored in the user's local application data folder with appropriate permissions
3. **Limited scope**: Only specific onboarding endpoints are whitelisted, not the entire API surface
4. **Validation still enforced**: API keys are validated against the actual providers before being marked as valid

### Endpoints Still Protected

The following endpoints remain protected by the middleware and require setup completion:
- Video generation endpoints
- Job management endpoints
- Dashboard and analytics endpoints
- User content endpoints
- All other business logic endpoints

## Files Changed

1. **`Aura.Api/Middleware/FirstRunMiddleware.cs`**
   - Added 3 new path prefixes to the whitelist (lines 34-36)

2. **`Aura.Tests/FirstRunMiddlewareTests.cs`** (new file)
   - Added 13 comprehensive test cases
   - Tests cover both positive and negative scenarios
   - Validates security boundaries remain intact

## Verification

All middleware tests pass:
- ✅ 13/13 FirstRunMiddleware tests pass
- ✅ 5/5 CorrelationIdMiddleware tests pass (existing)
- ✅ No regressions in related middleware tests

## Impact

### Before Fix
Users could not complete onboarding wizard:
1. Enter API key → Error: "Precondition Required"
2. Cannot proceed with setup
3. Application unusable for new users

### After Fix
Users can complete onboarding wizard successfully:
1. Enter API key → Saves successfully
2. Validates with provider → Shows validation result
3. Can proceed with setup
4. Application fully functional

- **Backend**: `Aura.Api/Program.cs` (API endpoints for save and validate)
- **Middleware**: `Aura.Api/Middleware/FirstRunMiddleware.cs` (request filtering)
- **Tests**: `Aura.Tests/FirstRunMiddlewareTests.cs` (test coverage)

## Future Considerations

This fix maintains the security model while enabling the onboarding flow. If additional onboarding features are added in the future that require new API endpoints, those endpoints should be evaluated and added to the whitelist as appropriate.

The test suite provides a clear template for validating new endpoints and ensuring the security boundaries remain correct.
