# Skip Button Bug Fix Summary

## Problem

When users clicked "Skip" during dependency installation in the onboarding wizard, the system incorrectly marked the dependency as "Installed" (with a green checkmark), leading users to believe the dependency was ready to use when it wasn't actually installed.

## Root Cause

In `FirstRunWizard.tsx`, the `handleSkipItem` function was dispatching the wrong action:

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (Bug)
const handleSkipItem = (itemId: string) => {
  dispatch({ type: 'INSTALL_COMPLETE', payload: itemId });  // Wrong action!
};
```

This caused the `onboarding` reducer to set `installed: true`, which was incorrect.

## Solution

### 1. Added "skipped" State
- Added `skipped: boolean` field to install items in onboarding state
- Created new `SKIP_INSTALL` action that properly marks items as skipped

### 2. Fixed Action Dispatch
```typescript
// ✅ AFTER (Fixed)
const handleSkipItem = (itemId: string) => {
  dispatch({ type: 'SKIP_INSTALL', payload: itemId });  // Correct action!
};
```

### 3. Updated UI to Show Skipped Status
- Added `'skipped'` to the Dependency status types
- Created distinct visual indicator for skipped dependencies
- Added helpful message and action buttons

## Visual Changes

### Dependency Status Badge

**Before** (Bug):
```
User clicks "Skip" → Badge shows: "✓ Installed" (green)
```

**After** (Fixed):
```
User clicks "Skip" → Badge shows: "⚠ Skipped" (warning/neutral)
```

### Dependency Details Panel

When a dependency is skipped, the details section now shows:

```
⚠ Skipped - You can install this later in Settings

Installation Options:
[Install Now]  [Download Guide]

Or assign existing installation:
[Path Selector with Browse button]
[Apply Path]
```

### Status Summary

The summary card now includes skipped count:
```
3 of 3 components installed (1/1 required), 1 skipped
```

## Behavior Comparison

### Scenario: User Skips Optional Dependency (e.g., Ollama)

| Aspect | Before (Bug) | After (Fixed) |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Badge | "Installed" (green) | "Skipped" (warning) |
| Icon | Green checkmark ✓ | Gray warning ⚠ |
| User Understanding | "It's installed" | "I skipped this" |
| Can Install Later | Hidden - appears done | "Install Now" button visible |
| State Tracking | `installed: true` | `skipped: true, installed: false` |

## Required vs Optional Dependencies

### Required Dependencies (FFmpeg)
- **Cannot be skipped** - No "Skip" button shown
- Must be installed to continue
- Warning shown if missing

### Optional Dependencies (Ollama, Stable Diffusion)
- **Can be skipped** - "Skip" button available
- Shows helpful message when skipped
- Easy to install later via "Install Now" button

## State Management

### New State Structure
```typescript
installItems: Array<{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  defaultPath?: string;
  required: boolean;
  installed: boolean;   // ← Was incorrectly set to true on skip
  installing: boolean;
  skipped: boolean;     // ← NEW: tracks actual skip state
}>
```

### State Transitions

**Skip Flow:**
```
SKIP_INSTALL → skipped: true, installed: false
```

**Install After Skip Flow:**
```
START_INSTALL → installing: true
INSTALL_COMPLETE → skipped: false, installed: true
```

## Files Changed

1. **`Aura.Web/src/components/Onboarding/DependencyCheck.tsx`**
   - Added `'skipped'` to Dependency status union type
   - Added skipped status icon and badge
   - Added skipped details section with install options

2. **`Aura.Web/src/state/onboarding.ts`**
   - Added `skipped: boolean` field to installItems
   - Added `SKIP_INSTALL` action type
   - Added SKIP_INSTALL reducer handler
   - Updated INSTALL_COMPLETE to clear skipped flag

3. **`Aura.Web/src/pages/Onboarding/FirstRunWizard.tsx`**
   - Fixed `handleSkipItem` to dispatch SKIP_INSTALL
   - Updated dependency status mapping to include skipped

4. **`Aura.Web/src/state/__tests__/onboarding.test.ts`**
   - Added test for SKIP_INSTALL action
   - Added test for clearing skipped flag on install

## Testing

✅ **All 961 tests pass**
- Including 2 new tests specifically for skip functionality
- Verified skipped flag is set correctly
- Verified skipped flag is cleared when install completes

✅ **TypeScript compilation succeeds**
- No type errors
- Strict mode enabled

✅ **Build succeeds**
- Development build completes successfully
- Pre-commit hooks pass

## Persistence

The skipped state is automatically persisted to localStorage as part of the wizard state:
- Saved via `saveWizardStateToStorage()` on state changes
- Loaded via `loadWizardStateFromStorage()` on wizard initialization
- Cleared via `clearWizardStateFromStorage()` on wizard completion

## User Experience Improvements

### Before (Confusing)
1. User unsure about optional dependency
2. Clicks "Skip" to defer decision
3. Sees "Installed" badge
4. **Thinks it's ready to use**
5. Later tries to use feature
6. **Feature fails** - dependency not actually installed
7. User confused and frustrated

### After (Clear)
1. User unsure about optional dependency
2. Clicks "Skip" to defer decision
3. Sees "Skipped" badge with warning icon
4. **Understands it's not installed**
5. Sees message: "You can install this later in Settings"
6. Sees "Install Now" button for easy installation
7. Can make informed decision

## Validation

The fix ensures that:
- ✅ Skip does NOT mark dependency as installed
- ✅ Skipped status is clearly differentiated from installed
- ✅ Users can easily install skipped dependencies later
- ✅ Required dependencies cannot be skipped
- ✅ State is persisted correctly
- ✅ Installing a skipped dependency clears the skipped flag

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

The following could be added in future PRs:
1. Dashboard banner showing count of skipped dependencies
2. Settings page section listing all skipped dependencies
3. Backend persistence of skipped status (currently frontend-only)
4. Analytics tracking of which dependencies are commonly skipped
