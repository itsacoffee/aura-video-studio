# Integration Testing and CI/CD Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive integration testing, contract validation, CI/CD pipeline enhancements, and deployment automation implemented for Aura Video Studio.

## Implementation Date

**Completed**: November 2, 2025

## Components Implemented

### 1. Contract Testing Infrastructure

#### Files Created
- `Aura.Api/Filters/CorrelationIdOperationFilter.cs` - Swagger operation filter for correlation ID documentation

- Frontend npm install and build
- Unit tests (backend and frontend)
- ESLint, type checking, formatting validation
- Placeholder scan enforcement

**Stage 2: API Contract Verification**
- OpenAPI schema generation
- Contract drift detection
- Automated PR comments on contract changes
- Schema artifact upload

**Stage 3: Integration Tests (Mocked)**
- Backend integration tests
- Frontend E2E contract smoke tests
- Fast execution with mocked providers

**Stage 4: Memory & Performance Checks**
- Playwright memory regression tests
- Heap profiling enabled
- Memory growth threshold validation

**Stage 5: E2E Smoke & Regression**
- Complete workflow tests
- Circuit breaker tests
- Templates performance tests
- First-run wizard tests
- Screenshot and report upload on failure

**Stage 6: Build Release Candidate**
- Full production build
- Frontend and backend artifact creation

- Artifact upload for deployment

#### Pipeline Features
- All stages must pass for PR approval
- Automated diagnostic bundle collection on failure
- PR summary comments with status
- Artifact retention (7-30 days based on type)
- Parallel execution where possible

### 4. Deployment Automation

#### Canary Deployment Script
`deploy/canary-deploy.sh` - 3-stage automated deployment:

**Stage 1: 5% Canary (10 minutes)**
- Deploy to 5% of instances
- Health checks every 30 seconds
- Validation: system health, provider health, correlation IDs

**Stage 2: 50% Expansion (10 minutes)**
- Scale to 50% of instances
- Continue health monitoring
- Same validation criteria

**Stage 3: 100% Rollout (5 minutes)**
- Complete deployment to all instances
- Final validation
- Old version retirement

#### Health Check Validation
- System health status (must not be "Down")
- Provider health monitoring
- Error rate comparison (< 300% of baseline)
- Latency P95 threshold (< 2000ms)
- Memory growth monitoring (< 500MB delta)
- Correlation ID presence verification

#### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- System health status becomes "Down"
- 3 consecutive health check failures
- Error rate exceeds threshold
- Memory growth exceeds threshold
- Latency exceeds threshold

### 5. Diagnostic Bundle Collection

#### Script Created
`scripts/diagnostics/collect-ci-diagnostics.sh`

#### Bundle Contents
- Application logs (API, frontend)
- Test results (unit, integration, E2E)
- Playwright reports and screenshots
- System information (Node, .NET, Git, disk, memory)
- Environment variables and package versions
- Build artifacts
- API diagnostics snapshots (health, providers)
- Contract schemas
- CI context (GitHub Actions info)

#### Features
