# First-Run Wizard Fix Summary

## Problem Statement

Upon first launch after building, the application would:
1. Take users to the Welcome page instead of launching the First-Run Wizard
2. The "Run Onboarding" button would just refresh the Welcome page instead of launching the wizard
3. There was no way to re-run the setup wizard after initial completion

## Root Causes

### 1. FirstRunWizard Redirect Bug
**Location**: `Aura.Web/src/pages/Onboarding/FirstRunWizard.tsx` lines 149-154

The wizard component checked `getLocalFirstRunStatus()` on mount and immediately redirected to "/" if it returned `true`, preventing users from ever re-running the wizard.

```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken)
const hasSeenOnboarding = getLocalFirstRunStatus();
if (hasSeenOnboarding) {
  navigate('/');
  return;
}
```

**Fix**: Removed the redirect check entirely, allowing the wizard to be accessed at any time.

### 2. App.tsx Error Handling Bug
**Location**: `Aura.Web/src/App.tsx` lines 120-123

When checking first-run status failed (e.g., backend not running), the error handler would set `shouldShowOnboarding = false`, causing the app to show the Welcome page instead of the onboarding wizard.

```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken)
catch (error) {
  console.error('Error checking first-run status:', error);
  setShouldShowOnboarding(false); // ❌ Wrong! Assumes completed
}
```

**Fix**: Changed error handling to check localStorage as a fallback, defaulting to showing onboarding if nothing is set.

```typescript
// AFTER (Fixed)
catch (error) {
  console.error('Error checking first-run status:', error);
  const localStatus = localStorage.getItem('hasCompletedFirstRun') === 'true' || 
                    localStorage.getItem('hasSeenOnboarding') === 'true';
  setShouldShowOnboarding(!localStatus); // ✅ Defaults to showing onboarding
}
```

### 3. Missing Re-Run Functionality
**Location**: `Aura.Web/src/components/Settings/GeneralSettingsTab.tsx`

There was no UI option to reset the wizard and run it again, forcing users to manually clear localStorage or database records.

**Fix**: Added a "Re-run Setup Wizard" button in Settings > General tab that:
1. Calls `resetFirstRunStatus()` to clear the completion flag
2. Navigates to `/onboarding` to launch the wizard

## Changes Made

### 1. FirstRunWizard.tsx
- Removed the automatic redirect logic that prevented re-running
- Removed unused import `getLocalFirstRunStatus`
- Simplified the useEffect to only check for saved progress

### 2. App.tsx
- Fixed error handling to check localStorage as fallback
- Changed default behavior to show onboarding when backend unavailable and no local flags set

### 3. GeneralSettingsTab.tsx
- Added import for `useNavigate` and `resetFirstRunStatus`
- Added new section "Setup Wizard" with description
- Added "Re-run Setup Wizard" button with confirmation dialog
- Added Title3 and Divider imports

### 4. App.firstRun.test.tsx (New)
- Added comprehensive unit tests for first-run detection logic
- Tests validate error handling fallback behavior
- Tests verify localStorage fallback works correctly
- Tests confirm legacy flag migration
- Tests validate re-run capability

## Test Results

✅ All 873 existing tests still pass
✅ Added 6 new tests, all passing
✅ Build verification passed
✅ Type check passed
✅ Linter passed
✅ No placeholder markers found

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
1. **First Launch**: Showed Welcome page instead of wizard (if backend failed)
2. **"Run Onboarding" Button**: Did nothing (just refreshed)
3. **Re-running Wizard**: Impossible without manual localStorage/DB editing

### After
1. **First Launch**: Always shows wizard on fresh install
2. **"Run Onboarding" Button**: Successfully launches wizard
3. **Re-running Wizard**: Easy via Settings > General > "Re-run Setup Wizard"

## Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Fresh install shows wizard automatically
- [ ] "Run Onboarding" button from Welcome page works
- [ ] "Re-run Setup Wizard" button in Settings works
- [ ] Wizard can be completed successfully
- [ ] Wizard can be re-run multiple times
- [ ] Completion status persists after restart
- [ ] Error scenarios (backend down) default to showing wizard

## Files Modified

1. `Aura.Web/src/pages/Onboarding/FirstRunWizard.tsx` - Removed redirect logic
2. `Aura.Web/src/App.tsx` - Fixed error handling
3. `Aura.Web/src/components/Settings/GeneralSettingsTab.tsx` - Added reset button
4. `Aura.Web/src/test/App.firstRun.test.tsx` - Added tests (new file)

## Related Issues

This fix addresses the core issue where:
- The wizard wouldn't launch on first run
- Users couldn't re-run the wizard
- The "Run Onboarding" button was non-functional

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Add wizard version tracking to prompt re-running after updates
- Add partial completion indicators in Settings
- Add wizard preview/help mode that doesn't modify settings
