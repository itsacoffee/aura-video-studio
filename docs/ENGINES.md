# Local Engines System - Overview

Aura Video Studio supports local, offline engines for image generation and text-to-speech, giving you full control over your creative pipeline without requiring cloud services or API keys.

## Supported Engines

### Image Generation
- **Stable Diffusion WebUI (A1111)** - Full-featured SD WebUI with API support
- **ComfyUI** - Node-based stable diffusion interface (planned)

**Requirements:**
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- Minimum 6GB VRAM for SD 1.5
- Minimum 12GB VRAM for SDXL
- Windows 11 x64 or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)

**GPU Detection and VRAM Requirements:**

Aura automatically detects your GPU and VRAM using multiple methods:
1. **nvidia-smi** (primary method for NVIDIA GPUs)
2. **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)** (fallback)
3. **dxdiag** (secondary fallback for accurate VRAM detection)

The system will only enable Local Stable Diffusion if:
- An NVIDIA GPU is detected (AMD/Intel not currently supported for SD)
- VRAM meets minimum requirements:
  - **6GB+**: SD 1.5 models supported
  - **8GB+**: SD 1.5 with higher quality settings
  - **12GB+**: SDXL models supported (recommended for best quality)

If your GPU doesn't meet these requirements, Aura will automatically fall back to:
- Stock images from Pexels/Pixabay/Unsplash (with free API keys)
- Pro cloud providers (Stability AI, Runway) if API keys are configured

**Note**: You can bypass hardware checks for experimental purposes, but this may result in out-of-memory errors or crashes.

### Text-to-Speech
- **Piper** - Fast, lightweight, offline TTS
  - Low latency, excellent for real-time use
  - Multiple voice models (English, Spanish, French, German, etc.)
  - No GPU required
  
- **Mimic3** - High-quality offline TTS server
  - Better voice quality than Piper
  - HTTP API for easy integration
  - Supports multiple voices and languages

- **Windows SAPI** - Built-in Windows TTS (always available)

## Installation

### Portable Installation
Local engines are installed to:
- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Aura\Tools\`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/aura/tools/`

- [Stable Diffusion Setup](./ENGINES_SD.md)
- [Local TTS Setup](./TTS_LOCAL.md)

## Engine Management

### Starting and Stopping Engines

Engines can be managed in two ways:

#### From Download Center (Recommended)

The Download Center provides a complete UI for engine management:

1. **Navigate to Download Center → Engines tab**
2. **Starting Engines**:
   - Click **Start** button on any installed engine
   - Monitor status change from "Installed" to "Running"
   - Health indicator shows "Healthy" when ready
   - View process ID and log file location
3. **Stopping Engines**:
   - Click **Stop** button on running engines
   - Engine will shut down gracefully
4. **Real-time Monitoring**:
   - Status updates every 5 seconds
   - Health checks for API availability
   - Error messages displayed inline
   - Log file paths shown for debugging

#### From Command Line

For automation or advanced users, use PowerShell scripts in `scripts/engines/`:
```powershell
# Windows
.\scripts\engines\launch_sd.ps1
.\scripts\engines\launch_piper.ps1
.\scripts\engines\launch_mimic3.ps1
```

### Health Checks

Aura automatically monitors engine health through HTTP endpoints:

- **Stable Diffusion WebUI**: Checks `/sdapi/v1/sd-models`
  - Polls every 2 seconds during startup (up to 120s timeout)
  - Verifies API is accessible and models are loaded
  
- **ComfyUI**: Checks `/system_stats`
  - Polls every 2 seconds during startup (up to 60s timeout)
  - Verifies node system is ready
  
- **Mimic3**: Checks `/api/voices`
  - Polls every 2 seconds during startup (up to 30s timeout)
  - Verifies voice models are available
  
- **Piper**: Binary validation
  - Checks executable exists and has correct permissions

**Health Status Indicators:**
- **Healthy (✓)**: Engine is running and API is responding
- **Unreachable**: Engine process is running but not responding to health checks (may still be starting up)
- **Not Running**: Engine is stopped

If an engine becomes unhealthy, Aura will:
1. Log the issue to engine-specific log files
2. Display error messages in the UI
3. Attempt to restart (if auto-restart is enabled)
4. Fall back to alternative providers if available

### Auto-Launch on Startup

Configure engines to start automatically when Aura launches:

1. Install and configure the engine through Download Center
2. Use the registry configuration file to enable auto-start
3. Engine will launch in the background on app startup
4. Check status in Download Center → Engines tab

*Note: UI for auto-launch configuration coming in a future update*

### Maintenance Operations

The Download Center provides maintenance tools:

- **Verify**: Check installation integrity
  - Validates all required files are present
  - Checks executable permissions
  - Reports missing or corrupted files
  
- **Repair**: Fix corrupted installations
  - Removes existing installation
  - Re-downloads and reinstalls the engine
  - Preserves configuration settings
  
- **Remove**: Clean uninstallation
  - Stops the engine if running
  - Removes all engine files
  - Cleans up registry entries
  - Preserves logs for troubleshooting

## Provider Selection and Fallback

Aura uses intelligent provider selection with automatic fallback:

### TTS Provider Priority
```
Pro Tier:
  ElevenLabs → PlayHT → Mimic3 → Piper → Windows

Free/Local Tier:
  Mimic3 → Piper → Windows
```

### Visual Provider Priority
```
Pro Tier:
  Stability AI → Runway → Local SD → Stock

Local Tier:
  Local SD → Stock

Free Tier:
  Stock
```

### Offline Mode
When offline mode is enabled, Aura will:
- Skip all cloud providers
- Use only local engines (SD, Piper, Mimic3)
- Fall back to stock assets and Windows TTS

## Performance Considerations

### Download and Installation Performance

Aura optimizes engine installation with:
- **Parallel downloads**: Multiple components can be downloaded simultaneously
- **Progressive SHA-256 verification**: Shows real-time progress during checksum verification
- **Resume support**: Interrupted downloads can be resumed (where supported)
- **Intelligent caching**: Previously downloaded components are reused

**Typical Installation Times** (on 100 Mbps connection):
- FFmpeg: ~2 minutes (80MB download)
- Piper TTS: ~5 minutes (varies by voice model)
- Stable Diffusion WebUI: ~15-30 minutes (2.5GB+ download)

### Stable Diffusion
- **SDXL**: 30-60 seconds per image (12GB+ VRAM)
- **SD 1.5**: 10-30 seconds per image (6GB+ VRAM)
- Consider batch generation for multiple scenes

### TTS Performance
- **Piper**: ~100x real-time (very fast)
- **Mimic3**: ~10x real-time (slower but higher quality)
- **Windows SAPI**: ~5x real-time

## Troubleshooting

### GPU Detection Issues

#### GPU Not Detected
If Aura doesn't detect your NVIDIA GPU:

1. **Verify nvidia-smi is working:**
   ```powershell
   nvidia-smi
   ```
   If this fails, your NVIDIA drivers may not be installed correctly.

2. **Check WMI detection:**
   ```powershell
   Get-WmiObject Win32_VideoController | Select-Object Name, AdapterRAM
   ```
   This should show your GPU and available memory.

3. **Manually verify VRAM with dxdiag:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `dxdiag`, press Enter
   - Go to "Display" tab
   - Look for "Dedicated Memory" or "Display Memory"
   - This shows your VRAM in MB (e.g., 8192 MB = 8 GB)

4. **Driver Installation:**
   - Download latest NVIDIA drivers from https://www.nvidia.com/drivers
   - Use "Clean installation" option during setup
   - Reboot after installation
   - Verify with `nvidia-smi`

#### Incorrect VRAM Detected
If Aura shows wrong VRAM amount:

- **WMI AdapterRAM is often unreliable** - Aura uses multiple detection methods
- Primary method: nvidia-smi (most accurate)
- Fallback 1: WMI VideoController
- Fallback 2: dxdiag parsing
- If all methods fail, manual override is available in Settings

#### Manual GPU Override
If automatic detection fails, you can manually configure your GPU:

1. Go to **Settings → System Profile → Hardware**
2. Disable "Auto-detect"
3. Select your GPU from preset list (e.g., "NVIDIA RTX 3080 - 10GB")
4. Or enter custom values for VRAM

### Stable Diffusion won't start
1. Check GPU requirements: `nvidia-smi` (Windows/Linux)
2. Verify installation path exists
3. Check logs at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Aura\logs\tools\stable-diffusion-webui.log`
4. Ensure ports are not in use (default: 7860)

### Piper/Mimic3 not working
1. Verify voice models are installed
2. Check binary path is correct
3. Review logs at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Aura\logs\tools\`
4. Try manual synthesis test

### Port conflicts
If default ports are in use:
1. Go to **Download Center → Engines**
2. Click **Start** with custom port
3. Or configure via API (see API Reference below)

## Security and Privacy

### Local Processing
- All generation happens on your machine
- No data sent to external services
- Full control over models and data

### Network Access
Local engines only bind to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) by default:
- **SD WebUI**: `http://127.0.0.1:7860`
- **Mimic3**: `http://127.0.0.1:59125`

### Model Safety
- Models are downloaded from official sources
- SHA-256 checksums verified on installation
- See manifest for source URLs and licenses

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Model Paths
Edit `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "Engines": {
    "StableDiffusion": {
      "ModelPath": "C:\\path\\to\\custom\\models"
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
Set custom environment for engines:
- `PYTHONPATH`: Custom Python path
- `HF_HOME`: Hugging Face cache directory
- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: Restrict GPU usage

### Advanced Arguments
Pass custom arguments to engines:
1. Go to **Settings → Engines → Advanced**
2. Edit command-line arguments
3. Restart engine for changes to take effect

## Uninstalling Engines
