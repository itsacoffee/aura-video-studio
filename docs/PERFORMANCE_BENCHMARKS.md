## Performance Recommendations

### Current State

✅ **Excellent**: System performs well within all target metrics  
✅ **Scalable**: Handles concurrent load effectively  
✅ **Efficient**: Low memory usage and no leaks  
✅ **Fast**: Quick script generation across all durations

### Future Optimizations

1. **Caching Strategy**: Implement intelligent caching for repeated requests
2. **Provider Pooling**: Pool external provider connections for reduced latency
3. **Async I/O**: Ensure all I/O operations are fully asynchronous
4. **Memory Profiling**: Continue monitoring for any memory growth patterns
5. **Hardware Acceleration**: Test with GPU-accelerated video rendering

### Monitoring

Continue monitoring these key metrics:
- Script generation time (target: <5s for all durations)
- Memory usage per job (target: <50MB)
- Memory leaks (target: <5MB after GC)
- Throughput scaling (target: >50% efficiency at 20 jobs)

## Appendix

### Running Benchmarks Locally

```bash
# Run all performance tests
dotnet test Aura.Tests/Aura.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Performance"

# Run with detailed output
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Performance" --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"

# View test results
# Results are output to console with timing information
```

### Interpreting Results

- **Execution Time**: Lower is better
- **Memory Usage**: Lower is better
- **Throughput**: Higher is better
- **Scalability**: Higher scaling factor is better

### Regression Thresholds
