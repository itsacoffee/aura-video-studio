/// Represents a video generation job with stage-by-stage progress tracking.

/// State Machine Invariants:
/// - Queued → Running → (Done | Failed | Canceled)
/// - Terminal states (Done, Failed, Canceled) cannot transition to any other state
/// - Progress (Percent) must be monotonically increasing (never decreases)
/// - EndedUtc must be set when entering any terminal state
/// 
/// Timestamp Invariants:
/// - CreatedUtc: Set on job creation, never changes
/// - QueuedUtc: Set when job enters Queued state (same as CreatedUtc for new jobs)
/// - StartedUtc: Set when job transitions from Queued to Running
/// - CompletedUtc: Set when job transitions to Done/Succeeded
/// - CanceledUtc: Set when job transitions to Canceled
/// - EndedUtc: Set to CompletedUtc, CanceledUtc, or FailedAt when entering terminal state
/// 
/// Resumability Rules:
/// - Jobs can only be resumed if CanResume is true
/// - Resume is supported for jobs that failed at specific checkpoints
/// - LastCompletedStep indicates the last successful checkpoint
/// - Not all stages support resumption (e.g., rendering is atomic)
