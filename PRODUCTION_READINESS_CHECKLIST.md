## PHASE 9: Model Selection and Control Verification

### 9.1 Model Selection Precedence Validation
- [ ] Set global default model for OpenAI
- [ ] Override with project-specific model
- [ ] Pin a stage-specific model
- [ ] Verify pinned model takes precedence over project override
- [ ] Test run-level override with CLI flag
- [ ] Confirm run override (pinned) takes highest precedence
- [ ] **Validation**: Check audit log shows correct resolution source
- [ ] **Status**: Not Started
- [ ] **Notes**:

### 9.2 Pin/Unpin Functionality
- [ ] Select a model in settings
- [ ] Click "Pin" button
- [ ] Verify lock icon appears
- [ ] Verify "Pinned" badge displays
- [ ] Attempt to change model selection
- [ ] Confirm pinned selection persists
- [ ] Unpin model
- [ ] Verify lock icon and badge disappear
- [ ] **Validation**: Check `AuraData/model-selections.json` for isPinned flag
- [ ] **Status**: Not Started
- [ ] **Notes**:

### 9.3 Model Unavailability Blocking
- [ ] Pin a model for a stage
- [ ] Temporarily make model unavailable (wrong API key or disconnect)
- [ ] Attempt to run video generation
- [ ] Verify blocking modal appears
- [ ] Confirm modal shows recommended alternatives
- [ ] Test "Apply recommended model" action
- [ ] Test "Retry with original" action
- [ ] Test "Cancel run" action
- [ ] **Validation**: Pipeline must not proceed without user action
- [ ] **Status**: Not Started
- [ ] **Notes**:

### 9.4 Automatic Fallback Settings
- [ ] Navigate to Settings → Model Selection
- [ ] Verify "Allow Automatic Fallback" toggle is OFF by default
- [ ] Attempt run with no model selection configured
- [ ] Confirm operation blocks (fallback disabled)
- [ ] Enable "Allow Automatic Fallback"
- [ ] Attempt same run
- [ ] Verify fallback model is used
- [ ] Check audit log for fallback notification
- [ ] **Validation**: Check `allowAutomaticFallback` in settings
- [ ] **Status**: Not Started
- [ ] **Notes**:

### 9.5 Deprecation Warning Flow
- [ ] Add a deprecated model to ModelRegistry with DeprecationDate
- [ ] Attempt to select deprecated model in UI
- [ ] Verify deprecation warning badge appears
- [ ] Confirm deprecation dialog shows on selection
- [ ] Review replacement model suggestion
- [ ] Test "Use Anyway" action
- [ ] Verify deprecation warning persists after selection
- [ ] **Validation**: API should return deprecationWarning in response
- [ ] **Status**: Not Started
- [ ] **Notes**:

### 9.6 Model Testing Feature
- [ ] Select a model in picker
- [ ] Click "Test" button
- [ ] Verify test runs (spinner shows)
- [ ] Confirm test result displays (success/failure)
- [ ] Check capability information (context window, max tokens)
- [ ] Test with invalid API key
- [ ] Verify appropriate error message
- [ ] **Validation**: Check `/api/models/test` endpoint response
- [ ] **Status**: Not Started
- [ ] **Notes**:

### 9.7 Model Selection Persistence
- [ ] Set multiple model selections (global, project, stage)
- [ ] Restart application
- [ ] Verify all selections persisted
- [ ] Check isPinned flags survived restart
- [ ] Verify selections load on startup
- [ ] Confirm no data loss
- [ ] **Validation**: Inspect `AuraData/model-selections.json` file
- [ ] **Status**: Not Started
- [ ] **Notes**:

### 9.8 Audit Trail Verification
- [ ] Perform several model resolutions (various precedence levels)
- [ ] Check audit log in settings
- [ ] Verify each entry shows:
  - Provider and stage
  - Selected model ID
  - Resolution source (e.g., "StagePinned", "GlobalDefault")
  - Timestamp
  - Job ID (if applicable)
  - Reasoning
- [ ] Confirm audit entries are in chronological order
- [ ] Verify last 1000 entries limit
- [ ] **Validation**: Review logs via UI or `AuraData/model-selections.json`
- [ ] **Status**: Not Started
- [ ] **Notes**:

### 9.9 CLI Model Override Testing
- [ ] Run video generation with `--model gpt-4o` flag
- [ ] Verify specified model is used
- [ ] Check audit log shows "RunOverride" source
- [ ] Run with `--model gpt-4o --pin-model` flag
- [ ] Verify pinned override takes precedence
- [ ] Test with unavailable model (should block)
- [ ] Test `--allow-auto-fallback` flag
- [ ] **Validation**: CLI flags properly passed to ModelResolutionService
- [ ] **Status**: Not Started
- [ ] **Notes**:

### 9.10 Per-Stage Model Selection
- [ ] Navigate to Settings → Model Selection
- [ ] Configure different models for:
  - Script generation stage
  - Visual prompts stage
  - Content analysis stage
- [ ] Run video generation
- [ ] Verify each stage uses its configured model
- [ ] Check audit log confirms per-stage usage
- [ ] Test with one stage pinned, others not
- [ ] **Validation**: Pipeline uses correct model per stage
- [ ] **Status**: Not Started
- [ ] **Notes**:

### 9.11 Clear Selections Functionality

- [ ] Use "Clear All" button
- [ ] Verify all selections removed
- [ ] Test "Clear Global Defaults" button
- [ ] Confirm only global selections cleared
- [ ] Test "Clear Project Overrides" button
- [ ] Confirm only project overrides cleared
- [ ] **Validation**: Check settings state after each clear action
- [ ] **Status**: Not Started
- [ ] **Notes**:

### 9.12 Preflight Model Validation
- [ ] Configure models for all stages
- [ ] Make one model unavailable (wrong API key)
- [ ] Run preflight check
- [ ] Verify preflight detects unavailable model
- [ ] Confirm warning or error displayed
- [ ] Test with all models available
- [ ] Verify preflight passes
- [ ] **Validation**: Preflight service correctly validates all models
