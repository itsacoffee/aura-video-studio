## Build Commands Available

### Development Build
```bash
cd Aura.Desktop
npm run build:dir
```
Builds unpacked application for testing without creating installer.

### Production Build (Windows)
```bash
cd Aura.Desktop
npm run build:win
```
Creates Windows installer (NSIS) and portable executable.

### Validation Only
```bash
cd Aura.Desktop
npm run validate
```
Validates configuration without building.

---

## Build Requirements

### Required for Development Build
- ✅ Node.js 18.0.0+ (18.18.0 recommended)
- ✅ npm 9.0.0+
- ✅ Electron dependencies installed

### Additional for Production Build
- ⚠️ Built backend (Aura.Api compiled to resources/backend/)
- ⚠️ Built frontend (Aura.Web/dist/ compiled)
- ⚠️ FFmpeg binaries (resources/ffmpeg/)
- 🔒 Code signing certificate (optional, for signed installer)

### For Signed Installer (Optional)
- Set `WIN_CSC_LINK` environment variable (path to .pfx or base64-encoded)
- Set `WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` environment variable
- Windows SDK installed (for signtool.exe)

---

## What Was Fixed

### Issue
```
⨯ Invalid configuration object. electron-builder 25.1.8 has been initialized 
using a configuration object that does not match the API schema.
 - configuration has an unknown property 'updater'.
```

### Solution
Removed the invalid `updater` block from `Aura.Desktop/package.json`:

**Before** (Lines 131-137):
```json
"updater": {
  "enabled": true,
  "autoDownload": false,
  "autoInstallOnAppQuit": true,
  "allowDowngrade": false,
  "allowPrerelease": false
}
```

**After**:
```json
// Property removed
```

### Auto-Update Functionality Preserved
The auto-updater still works through:
- `electron-updater` package (v6.6.2)
- Runtime configuration in `electron/main.js` (lines 185-270)

```javascript
// In electron/main.js
autoUpdater.autoDownload = false;
autoUpdater.autoInstallOnAppQuit = true;
// ... full configuration ...
```

## Build Process Flow

### 1. Preparation Phase ✅
- Dependencies installed
- Configuration validated
- Schema checks passed

### 2. Asset Gathering (When Building)
- Backend binaries from `resources/backend/`
- Frontend files from `../Aura.Web/dist/`
- FFmpeg binaries from `resources/ffmpeg/`
- Icons and assets from `assets/`

### 3. Electron Packaging
- Electron binaries downloaded (v32.3.3)
- Application packaged with Electron
- Native modules rebuilt for target platform

### 4. Installer Creation
- NSIS installer created (with setup wizard)
- Portable executable created (single .exe)
- File associations registered (.aura, .avsproj)

### 5. Code Signing (Optional)
- Installer signed with certificate if available
- Multiple timestamp servers for reliability
- Verified signature applied

## Testing Checklist

Before considering the build complete, test:

### Installation
- [ ] NSIS installer runs on clean Windows 11
- [ ] Custom installation path works
- [ ] Desktop shortcut created
- [ ] Start menu entry created
- [ ] File associations registered

### First Run
- [ ] Splash screen displays
- [ ] Windows Setup Wizard runs
- [ ] .NET 8 check passes or prompts installation
- [ ] Backend starts successfully
- [ ] Frontend loads correctly
- [ ] Main window appears

### Functionality
- [ ] All menu items work
- [ ] IPC communication works
- [ ] Backend API responds
- [ ] Video generation initializes
- [ ] Settings persist
- [ ] Auto-update check works

### Cleanup
- [ ] Application closes gracefully
- [ ] Backend terminates properly
- [ ] Uninstaller removes all files
- [ ] Registry entries cleaned
- [ ] No orphaned processes

## Known Warnings (Non-Critical)

### Deprecated Package Warnings
These warnings are from electron-builder's transitive dependencies:
```
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3
npm warn deprecated rimraf@3.0.2
(and others...)
```

**Impact**: None - packages work correctly  
**Resolution**: Automatic when electron-builder updates dependencies  
**Action Required**: None

### Missing Source Warnings During Test Build
```
file source doesn't exist from=/path/to/backend
file source doesn't exist from=/path/to/frontend
```

**Impact**: Expected for configuration validation tests  
**Resolution**: Build backend and frontend before production build  
**Action Required**: Build all components before final packaging

---

## Next Steps for Production Build

### 1. Build Backend
```bash
cd Aura.Api
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained
# Copy output to Aura.Desktop/resources/backend/win-x64/
```

### 2. Build Frontend
```bash
cd Aura.Web
npm run build
# Output will be in dist/ - referenced by electron-builder
```

### 3. Add FFmpeg Binaries
```bash
# Download or copy FFmpeg binaries
# Place in Aura.Desktop/resources/ffmpeg/win-x64/bin/
# Required: ffmpeg.exe, ffprobe.exe
```

### 4. Run Production Build
```bash
cd Aura.Desktop
npm run build:win
```

### 5. Test Installer
```bash
# Located in: Aura.Desktop/dist/
# Files: Aura Video Studio-Setup-1.0.0.exe
#        Aura Video Studio-1.0.0-x64.exe (portable)
```

---

## Build Artifacts

After successful build, expect these files in `dist/`:

### NSIS Installer
- `Aura Video Studio-Setup-1.0.0.exe` (~200-300 MB)
- Full installation wizard
- System-wide installation
- Uninstaller included

### Portable Executable  
- `Aura Video Studio-1.0.0-x64.exe` (~200-300 MB)
- Single executable
- No installation required
- Extracts to temp directory on run

### Additional Files
- `builder-debug.yml` (build metadata)
- `latest.yml` (auto-update manifest)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Backend executable not found"
**Solution**: Build and copy backend to resources/backend/win-x64/

### "Frontend files not found"
**Solution**: Build frontend with `npm run build` in Aura.Web/

### "FFmpeg not found"
**Solution**: Add FFmpeg binaries to resources/ffmpeg/win-x64/bin/

### "Certificate error during signing"
**Solution**:
- Verify WIN_CSC_LINK and WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD are set
- Or disable signing by not setting these variables

### "Port already in use"
**Solution**: Backend will auto-find available port - not an issue

---

## Success Criteria

✅ All verification tests passed  
✅ Configuration schema valid  
✅ No critical issues in code review  
✅ Security measures implemented  
✅ Documentation complete  

**Status**: Ready to build production installer when all components are compiled.
