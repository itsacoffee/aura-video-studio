# Contributing to Aura Video Studio

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Aura Video Studio! This guide outlines the development workflow and standards for the project.

## Platform Requirements

**Aura Video Studio is an Electron desktop application targeting Windows 11 (x64) primarily, with cross-platform capability.**

While the application is designed to support Windows, macOS, and Linux through Electron, the current primary focus is Windows 11 (64-bit).

**Development Prerequisites:**
- **Node.js 20.0.0 or higher** for all JavaScript/TypeScript components (Aura.Web frontend and Aura.Desktop Electron app)
- **.NET 8 SDK** for backend components
- **npm 9.0.0 or higher**
- **Git** with long paths enabled (Windows)
- **FFmpeg 4.0+** for video rendering
- **Windows 11** recommended for Windows-specific builds

**Cross-Platform Development:**
- **Backend (.NET)**: Fully cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Frontend (React)**: Fully cross-platform
- **Electron**: Cross-platform framework
- **Installers**: Platform-specific builds (electron-builder)

**See the complete setup guide:** [BUILD_GUIDE.md](BUILD_GUIDE.md)

## Development Standards

### No Placeholder Policy

This project maintains a **zero-tolerance policy for placeholder markers** in source code. All code committed must be production-ready with no future work markers.

#### Forbidden Comment Patterns

The following comment patterns are **strictly prohibited** in source code:

- `// TODO`
- `// FIXME`
- `// HACK`
- `// XXX`
- `// WIP`
- `/* TODO`
- `/* FIXME`
- `/* HACK`
- `/* WIP`

**Note:** General comments about "future enhancements" or "planned features" in regular prose are acceptable. This policy specifically targets code comment markers that indicate incomplete work.

#### Enforcement

**Automated checks:**

```bash
# Scan for placeholder markers
node scripts/audit/find-placeholders.js
```

**Pre-commit hooks:**
- Git hooks automatically run before each commit
- Commits with placeholder markers will be rejected
- Located in `.husky/pre-commit`

**CI/CD validation:**
- All PRs are automatically scanned
- PRs with placeholders will fail CI checks
- See `.github/workflows/build-validation.yml`

**To bypass hooks** (not recommended, CI will still catch it):
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
```
- Detailed reporting with verbose mode

**Usage:**

```powershell
# Run the audit
pwsh scripts/audit/no_future_text.ps1

# Run with verbose output
pwsh scripts/audit/no_future_text.ps1 -Verbose
```

#### Allowed Exceptions

The following types of files are allowed to contain these phrases:
- Meta-documentation about the cleanup process itself
- User-facing instructional guides with "Next Steps" for users
- CI documentation explaining workflow patterns

See the `$AllowedFiles` array in `scripts/audit/no_future_text.ps1` for the complete list.

### CI Integration

The audit script runs automatically in CI pipelines:
- **Windows CI** (`.github/workflows/ci-windows.yml`)
- **Linux CI** (`.github/workflows/ci-linux.yml`)
- **No Placeholders Workflow** (`.github/workflows/no-placeholders.yml`)

Pull requests that introduce forbidden placeholder text will fail the CI checks.

### What to Do Instead

Instead of adding placeholder text:

1. **For unimplemented features:** Don't mention them in documentation until they're implemented
2. **For work in progress:** Use feature branches and don't merge until complete
3. **For improvements:** Document only what currently exists; file GitHub issues for future work
4. **For user instructions:** Use "To continue:" or "To complete:" instead of "Next steps:"

## Building and Testing

See [BUILD_GUIDE.md](BUILD_GUIDE.md) for detailed build instructions.

### Quick Start

**Desktop App Build:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd Aura.Web && npm install
cd ../Aura.Desktop && npm install

# Build frontend
cd ../Aura.Web && npm run build:prod

# Build backend
cd ../Aura.Api && dotnet build -c Release

# Run Electron app
cd ../Aura.Desktop && npm run dev
```

**Component Development:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd Aura.Api && dotnet watch run

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd Aura.Web && npm run dev
```

**Testing:**
```bash
# Frontend tests
cd Aura.Web
npm test

# Backend tests
dotnet test

# E2E tests
cd Aura.Web
npm run playwright
```

### End-to-End Testing

The project includes comprehensive E2E tests using Playwright.

#### Running E2E Tests Locally

```bash
cd Aura.Web

# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npm run playwright:install

# Run all E2E tests
npm run playwright

# Run specific test suites
npx playwright test tests/e2e/full-pipeline.spec.ts

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npm run playwright:ui
```

3. **Memory Regression Tests** (`memory-regression.spec.ts`):
   - Memory leak detection during pagination
   - Performance with large datasets
   - Event listener cleanup
   - Resource cleanup after job completion

4. **Complete Workflow Tests** (`complete-workflow.spec.ts`):
   - Full video generation flow
   - Error recovery
   - Progress tracking

#### Testing with Mocked Providers (Fast)

The E2E tests use mocked providers by default for fast, deterministic execution:

```bash
# Tests run with mocked responses
npm run playwright
```

#### Testing with Docker Compose (Full Stack)

For full integration testing locally:

```bash
# Start services with docker-compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build

# Run E2E tests against local stack
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5005 npm run playwright

# Stop services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down
```

#### Memory and Performance Testing

Memory regression tests check for leaks and performance degradation:

```bash
# Run memory tests with heap profiling
npx playwright test tests/e2e/memory-regression.spec.ts --project=chromium

# View memory test results
cat Aura.Web/test-results/memory-regression-*.txt
```

**Memory test thresholds**:
- Memory growth during scrolling: <50%
- Template rendering time: <5s for 1000 items
- Virtualized items rendered: <100 (out of 1000)

### Integration Testing

Backend integration tests validate end-to-end flows:

```bash
# Run integration tests only
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Integration"

# Run with detailed output
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Integration" --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

## Code Quality

- **Line Coverage:** Maintain at least 60% line coverage for .NET code
- **Web Coverage:** Maintain at least 70% coverage for tested files
- **Build Warnings:** Fix new warnings introduced by your changes
- **Analyzer Rules:** Follow the analyzer rules defined in `Directory.Build.props`
- **ESLint:** All code must pass ESLint with zero warnings and errors

### Linting Standards (Frontend)

The frontend codebase enforces strict ESLint rules with `--max-warnings 0`. All code must pass linting before merging.

#### Running Lint Checks

```bash
# Check for errors and warnings
cd Aura.Web
npm run lint

# Auto-fix fixable issues
npm run lint:fix

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Run all quality checks
npm run quality-check
```

#### Common Linting Patterns

**1. Avoid `any` Types**

```typescript
// ❌ Bad
const handler = (event: any) => { };

// ✅ Good  
const handler = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => { };
```

**2. React Hooks Dependencies**

```typescript
// ❌ Bad - missing dependencies
useEffect(() => {
  loadData();
}, []);

// ✅ Good - include all dependencies
const loadData = useCallback(async () => {
  // ...
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);

useEffect(() => {
  loadData();
}, [loadData]);
```

**3. Accessibility**

```typescript
// ❌ Bad - div with onClick but no keyboard support
<div onClick={handler}>Click me</div>

// ✅ Good - use semantic HTML
<button onClick={handler}>Click me</button>

// ✅ Also acceptable - div with proper ARIA
<div 
  role="button"
  tabIndex={0}
  onClick={handler}
  onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && handler()}
>
  Click me
</div>
```

**4. Console Statements**

```typescript
// ❌ Bad - debug console.log
console.log('Debug info:', data);

// ✅ Good - use allowed console methods (error, warn, info)
console.error('Error occurred:', error);

// ✅ Good - conditional debug logging with disable comment
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
  console.log('Debug info:', data);
}
```

**5. Unused Variables**

```typescript
// ❌ Bad
const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
// setValue is never used

// ✅ Good - prefix with underscore if intentionally unused
const [value, _setValue] = useState(0);

// ✅ Better - don't destructure if not needed
const value = useState(0)[0];
```

#### ESLint Disable Comments

When you need to disable a rule, always provide a justification:

```typescript
// Dialog needs to be focusable for keyboard accessibility
// eslint-disable-next-line jsx-a11y/no-noninteractive-tabindex
tabIndex={0}
```

## Architectural Patterns

Aura Video Studio follows specific architectural patterns to ensure code quality and maintainability. Violating these patterns may result in PR rejection.

### Key Resources

📚 **Read these documents before contributing:**

- **[docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md)** - Explains *why* we made certain architectural choices
- **[docs/COMMON_PITFALLS.md](docs/COMMON_PITFALLS.md)** - Lists common mistakes and anti-patterns to avoid

### Core Principles

1. **No Reflection for Dependency Access**
   - ❌ Never use `GetField()` or `GetProperty()` to access private members of dependencies
   - ✅ Use proper dependency injection with interfaces
   - Example: Use `IOllamaDirectClient` instead of reflecting into `OllamaLlmProvider`

2. **React Component Refs over QuerySelectors**
   - ❌ Never use `querySelector` with Fluent UI class names (they're hashed and change between builds)
   - ✅ Use React refs for stable DOM element access
   - Example: `const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)` then `<div ref={ref}>`

3. **Atomic Job State Updates**
   - ❌ Never set job status to "completed" without providing `outputPath`
   - ✅ Always update status and outputPath together atomically
   - Example: `UpdateJobStatusAsync(id, "completed", 100, outputPath: "/path/to/file")`

4. **Video Preview Synchronization**
   - ❌ Don't check `isPlaying` before syncing video position
   - ✅ Always sync video element time, even when paused (for seek support)
   - Example: `playbackStore.setCurrentTime(video.currentTime)` (no `isPlaying` check)

5. **SSE Connection Best Practices**
   - ❌ Don't use fixed delays before connecting to SSE
   - ✅ Connect immediately with timeout and polling fallback
   - ✅ Implement exponential backoff for polling when SSE fails

### Code Review Checklist

Before submitting your PR, ensure:

- [ ] No use of reflection to access private fields (use DI interfaces instead)
- [ ] No `querySelector` with Fluent UI class names (use refs)
- [ ] Job status "completed" transitions include `outputPath`
- [ ] Video synchronization works when paused (not just playing)
- [ ] SSE connections have timeout and graceful fallback
- [ ] All async job operations check BOTH status AND outputPath for completion
- [ ] Error handling uses `unknown` type, not `any`
- [ ] No `.Result` or `.Wait()` on async methods in C#
